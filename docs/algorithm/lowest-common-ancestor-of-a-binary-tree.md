# Lowest common ancestor of a Binary Tree


Lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in the tree that has both n1 and n2 as descendants.



## Finding lowest common ancestor


Consider the tree:

Lowest common ancestor of nodes with value 1 and 4 is 2

Lowest common ancestor of nodes with value 1 and 5 is 3

Lowest common ancestor of nodes with value 2 and 4 is 4

Lowest common ancestor of nodes with value 1 and 2 is 2
